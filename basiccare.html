			<p>Below is the very basics of how to look after your dog, and ensure they live happily and healthily!</p>
		</div>


		<section>
				<h3>Regular Vet Visits</h3>
        <p>No matter the age your dog, regular check-up at your local vet will help to keep your dog sate
          Trom any associated diseases or infections that could cause them distress or put their life at risk.
          Having a log of what injections your dog has had will be helpful for your vet to keep your dog up
          to date to give it the best chance of a long, happy life. A vet will also give specialist advice for
          your dog as there are circumstances where your dog may need to be exercised more, fed a
          different diet or go onto medication to improve its quality of life as some breeds have known
          issues or informalities.</p>
		</section>

    <section>
      <h3>Regular baths/grooming</h3>
      <p>Regular maintenance of your dog's fur coat, teeth and nails will improve its wellbeing and
        reduce the risk of infections or diseases from occurring. Fleas, dirty water and mud are leading
        causes of issues to your dog's health. They can cause prolonged itchiness, fleas, worms all these
        however can be mitigated or treated with tablets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Balanced feeding times and amounts</h3>
      <p>Giving your dog a healthy diet with regular mealtimes will help keep it hedthy with strong
        bones, high energy levels and maintain a healthy weight. The vet can advise on what size
        portion to give and how regular, but the general basis would be 2 times a day with a hand sized
        portion roughly depending on the dogs size. A variety of food can be found at the shops with
        their being the generic budget food all the way to high end organic food, but you should go off
        what you can afford and what the dog requires.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Regular Exercise/outdoor freedom</h3>
      <p>Regular exercise is a must for all dog breeds. Each breed will vary on how much is required with
        some requiring just a small walk to others requiring a few hours of high energy exercise.
        Exercise will help to keep your dog calm and reduce agitation or aggression. Moreover, your
        dog's weight will be managed and the fog will feel better growing its muscles and retaining its
        strong bones which it requires for a happy, healthy day to day lifestyle. If you are leaving your
        dog indoors for long periods, make sure it is left in a well-ventilated area with space for it to
        Wander around to its water/food bowl. Ensure it is able to go outdoors as soon as you are back
        though or your dogs behaviour may become agitated or aggressive.</p>
